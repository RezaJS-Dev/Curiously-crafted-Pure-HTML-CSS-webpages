# Curiously-crafted-Pure-HTML-CSS-webpages
"Curiously crafted webpages" are HTML-CSS-only projects that are dynamic and responsive without the help of JavaScript code.

This repository contains some examples of Pure-HTML-CSS-Made webpages.

If you want to download the examples and run them locally, you'll need to run them through a local web server.

Although the http-server package is available in the package.json file as a dependency for the npm module,
so it is run after using the 'npm install' command, or you can just use 'npx http-server' command.

Also my 2025 resume' is attached to this repository which is powered by Bootstrap5.
